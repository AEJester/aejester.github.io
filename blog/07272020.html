      <h1>Introducing Mercury</h1>
      <p class="lead">Ryan Monaghan</p>
      
      <h2>The Idea</h2>
      <p class="lead">I initlally came up with the idea for mercury as a reddit client, but that quickly pivoted. I wanted to design an experience that felt like an iPhone weather app. I used my existing dark sky account because
      the API had been shut off to the public after its recent acquisition by apple. I started off very simple, with <code>ScrollView</code> and <code>ListView</code> components left and right. That changed after I realized I could create a swipe gesture that allowed
      the user to control a "bar" that can hide/show content based on the position. I implemented this and was immediately hooked. I changed the hourly and daily <code>ScrollView</code> into <code>TabView</code> for page control,
      added a TabBar for ease of navigation, and tons of customization settings to keep things fresh.</p>
      
      <h2>Adding Features</h2>
      <p class="lead">After this redesign, I knew the app was missing key features. It needed radar, and it needed search. I looked into the Places API by Google, but it was very costly and I do not have a large budget. I then found out I could
      implement the search autocompleter from Apple Maps. It worked to my surprise, and I was very happy that I did not have to pay. I then looked all over the internet for an API for weather radar, and found the RainViewer API, which worked very well for the purposes that I had.
      After this, I had to overlay the radar tiles onto the MapView, which was also surprisngly easy.</p>
      
      <h2>Multiplatofm Support</h2>
      <p class="lead">After doing all of this, I wanted to make my app look good on all platforms. iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS were my primary targets (tvOS in the future?).I had put in simple conditions which allowed me to take a few extra lines of code in my iOS app, and make them look
      good on the other platforms I had selected. watchOS is different because it needs to be a separate target but I have not started developing for the watch yet so I do not know. Anyway, After I had done this, It was time that I moved on to my final feature.</p>
      
      <h2>Widget Support</h2>
      <p class="lead">Widgets were one of my inspirations for creating this app in the first place. I wanted the challenge of buiding a widget that was consistent with the app screen, but also delivered the same rich data that was available in the app. I had started with the small
      sized widget, and moved on to medium and large after I had got the small one working to my satisfaction. I was ready to finally submit my app after months of work.</p>
